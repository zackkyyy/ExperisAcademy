Task 17

For the week you will be building a Java app for storing (and accessing) contact information in a Database.
You will need to design and implement tables to store this information:â€¨

- First Name
- Last Name
- Contact Number (multiple possible - work/home/mobile/etc)
- E-mail Address (multiple possible - work/personal/etc)
- Home Address (may be shared by people)
- Date of Birth
- Family/Blood Relationship (Only close ones - mother/father/brother/sister)


Divide yourselves into groups of three or four
Later in the week we will cover the basics of WebApps

For now design the database and transactions
Some design considerations:

- The app must perform CRUD operations for all tables
- The app must allow me to search by name/surname/telephone number.
- For a given contact it must show the related contacts and how they are related.

ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- The app must have a public API that exposes the values as JSON
- The app must have a web interface for browsing existing contacts
- There must be methods for adding data (Web forms are not a requirement)
- Specifically, you must create Post Mappings but they only need to be usable via Postman/Console
- OPTIONAL: Web based forms for editing/adding contacts
- OPTIONAL: Hosted on Heroku (Hand in both source and Heroku Link in README.md file)

HINT: See Thursdays optional task

THERE WILL NOT BE ANY FURTHER FEATURE CREEP
