Task 14

Read this documentation.

Now write an application that connects to an API of Fire and Ice

Your application needs to have the following THREE features:

- It should allow me to lookup a character by number. (Display basic info for that character.)
- It should then optionally allow me to display the names of all sworn members of the previous characters house.
- It must then lookup all povCharacters in the books published by "Bantam Books", it must then display this information in a grid. (Which characters are point-of-view in which books?)

The solution should be console based.
