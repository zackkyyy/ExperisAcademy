Task 13

Build a an Animal Class

This may be done using IntelliJ

An animal can be Herbivore, Carnivore or Omnivore
Create Interfaces for movement types:

- Walk, Run, Fly, Swim Climb
- Each should write a string the the console

The animal class should provide a means for “exposing” a list of movement types (Perhaps a list of enums?)
Build a console application that that creates a collection of Animals
Create a variety of animals (Min. 3)
For each animal, randomly pick one of its movement types and display (run it).

Example output for cat (walk, run, climb):
> The cat can walk, run, and climb.
> The cat runs.

OPTIONAL:
Switch up the structure,
Pre-compile the animal class into a package (.jar)
Import the package separately into a different project and use that instead of the uncompiled version
