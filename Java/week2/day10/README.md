Task 16

Build a simple app that uses a sqlite file to store data
Print out ‘some’ data from any one of the tables

Use the Northwind database (the small version!)
Here: https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3/raw/master/Northwind_small.sqlite

Access the database and perform a select statement
IE: http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-java/select/

The connection string should be in this format :
"jdbc:sqlite::resource:DatabaseFile"

Be aware that the table names may be singular Product NOT Products ... etc
