Task 4

Write and compile a .java file which can be used to print a rectangle of size chosen by the user at run-time. The rectangle should have an outer edge and a second inner edge. There must be one space between in the inner and outer edge.
The rectangle can be made of any character that you choose. (# is probably a good choice) You may choose the orientation yourself.
The file must compile without errors.

I use _ to show a space here (Yours should be blank)
example (after compilation):

$ java program 7 8
