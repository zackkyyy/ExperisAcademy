Task 3

Write and compile a .java file which can be used to print a square of size chosen by the user at run-time.
The square can be made of any character that you choose. (# is probably a good choice)
The file must compile without errors.

I use _ to show a space here (Yours should be blank)

example:

$ java program 5

\#\#\#\#\#  
\#\_\_\_\#  
\#\_\_\_\#  
\#\_\_\_\#  
\#\#\#\#\#  

Submit both the source code and the compiled code
